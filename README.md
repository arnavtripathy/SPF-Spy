# SPF-Spy
This mini project was built by me with a view of automating the testing of security of email domains. I use sendgrid API's and a crawler to check for email security and try to send an email . If it suceeds , it is most probably vulnerable. Can be used in generating POC's. Still a few modules missing, will update soon
